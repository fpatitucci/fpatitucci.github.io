I’m a third-year Ph.D. student in ECE at UT Austin, working with Prof. Aryan Mokhtari on optimization and machine learning. My research focuses on optimization algorithms; for more details, please refer to my publications.

Previously, I completed my engineering degree at Universidad Nacional de La Plata, where I received the 2022 “Ing. Isidoro Marín” Medal from the Argentinian National Academy of Engineering. I also began an M.Sc. in Mathematical Engineering at the Universidad de Buenos Aires before starting my Ph.D.
