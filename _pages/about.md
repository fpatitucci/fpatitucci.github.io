I’m a third-year Ph.D. student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Texas at Austin, advised by [Prof. Aryan Mokhtari](https://sites.utexas.edu/mokhtari/). My research focuses on optimization algorithms for machine learning; for more details, please see my publications page.

Before starting my Ph.D., I completed my engineering degree at the Universidad Nacional de La Plata, where I received the 2022 Ing. Isidoro Marín Medal from the Argentinian National Academy of Engineering. I also began an M.Sc. in Mathematical Engineering at the Universidad de Buenos Aires.
