 I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the ECE Department (DICE track), at the University of Texas at Austin, advised by Prof. Aryan Mokhtari. 

Before joining UT Austin, I completed my engineering degree at Universidad Nacional de La Plata, and I was pursuing an MSc in Mathematical Engineering at Universidad de Buenos Aires (currently on hold).
