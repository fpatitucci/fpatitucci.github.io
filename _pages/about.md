 I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the ECE Department (DICE track), at the University of Texas at Austin, advised by Prof. Aryan Mokhtari. 


Before joining UT Austin, I completed my engineering degree at Universidad Nacional de La Plata, where I obtained the “Ing. Isidoro Marín” 2022 Medal from the Argentinian National Academy of Engineering due to my academic performance. In addition, I was pursuing an M.Sc. in Mathematical Engineering at Universidad de Buenos Aires (currently on hold).
